        I was definitely not surprised when, on Instagram, I asked what subjects
        and topics related to gender, sexuality, and spirituality people would
        be interested in discussing and the vast majority responded with PURITY
        CULTURE. It’s a cultural phenomenon that perfectly falls in the centre
        of the venn diagram of gender, sexuality, and spirituality.

        <SubHeader>What is purity culture?</SubHeader>
        <BlogParagraph>
          Linda Kay Klien in her book <i>Pure</i>, explains that the term
          “purity culture” is most often associated with the white, American,
          Evangelical Christian Purity Movement of the 1990s. Ah how lucky I was
          to be brought up during this time. However, evangelicals and
          millennials don’t have the monopoly- Mormons use the word
          “worthiness”, Muslims call it “honor culture” and so many of the core
          tenants of purity culture (aka gender expectations and sexual-control)
          are represented in some way in all patriarchal cultures.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          I'll give a little more context for what I mean when I talk about
          “purity culture”. Purity culture has strict and stereotypical
          expectations when it comes to gender. It mandates a binary
          interpretation; men do certain specific things and women do certain
          specific things. Men are to be strong; to be “masculine” heads of the
          household, the church, and society. Women are expected to support men
          and to be submissive; to be “feminine” and sweet, devoted wives and
          mothers. The expectation is that “pure” young women will remain under
          the authority of their fathers until they trade it for the authority
          of their husbands, thus reinforcing male domination. These
          expectations restrict both men and women's freedom; stripping them
          both of their full humanity, although arguably, affecting women to a
          more corporeal extent.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          Both men and women are expected to remain sexually “pure” until
          marriage. This includes abstaining from sex, but it also extends to
          avoiding lustful thoughts and not masturbating. Men and boys, however,
          who are seen as sexually depraved (whereas women and girls are seen as
          naturally non-sexual) are generally given far more sexual leeway
          before marriage. For young women, being “pure” also means being
          responsible for the boys and men around them and behaving in ways that
          do not “tempt” others to sin. Jessica Valenti, in her book,{" "}
          <i>The Purity Myth</i>, explains the messaging plainly, we’re told,
          “Boys want sex and they'll do anything to get it and girls own sex and
          have to keep it.” Then, once you get married, you are expected to flip
          a switch and totally turn on your sexuality, resulting in a beautiful,
          easy and blessed sex life with your spouse.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          Additionally, purity culture tells a story that a girl's virginity is
          held up as a moral ideal above all else, a story in which the most
          important characteristic of a young woman is whether or not she is
          sexually active. This narrative of good girls and bad girls; virgins
          and whores, is a story that often follows women throughout their
          lives.{" "}
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          It also strongly reinforces that heterosexual sex and desire is the
          only “right” and “normal” form of sex and desire. Anything that
          deviates from the narrow script of sexuality provided is sinful and
          perverted, outside of the ‘natural order of things’.{" "}

        What has purity culture looked like in my own experience?
      </SubHeader>
      <BlogParagraph>
        I was given a purity ring by my well-intentioned dad when I turned
        thirteen.
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        I went to a youth group where they held up an apple and at the beginning
        of the sermon had some boys come up and take a few bites out of it. They
        then left it to the side to let it brown and shrivel. At the end of the
        talk, about waiting to have sex until you were married, they told us to
        look at the apple. That, they said, was what happens when you give your
        purity away; when you let boys “take bites out of you”, they take pieces
        of you that you will never get back; you become undesirable to your
        future husband and no one wants an old half eaten apple.{" "}
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        I read a book called ‘I Kissed Dating Goodbye” and signed a pledge that
        said “True Love Waits”. (If you read this book too, you might be
        interested in Joshua Harris’{" "}

        in which he talks about being wrong)
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        At Christian camp, from the time that I began going at age 8, all of the
        girls were required to wear one-piece bathing suits or baggy t-shirts
        over their suits (if they were deemed too sexy) so as to not “cause the
        boys to stumble”.{" "}
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        At the same Christian camp, one of the rules was that you could not
        interlace your fingers while holding hands with someone of the opposite
        sex because that led to what they liked to call “making purple” (aka
        having sex). Because, of course, blue and pink make purple.{" "}
      </BlogParagraph>

      <BlogParagraph>
        I remember sitting with a friend from youth group in her bathroom as she
        took a pregnancy test after having sex with her boyfriend. Even though
        the test was negative, I remember feeling so devastated for her because
        now that she wasn’t a virgin her life was effectively over. No man would
        want her “baggage”. I also secretly felt so pious and superior that I
        had not succumb to temptation in this way (not that I had a boyfriend to
        have sex with anyway).{" "}
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        At my Christian University they had an event aimed at providing a safe
        space for female students to ask married staff their questions about
        sex. The basic concept of this seemed positive, as I am all for safe
        spaces to explore and share ideas amongst women, especially about sex!
        However, the event was predicated on the idea that all of the unmarried
        students were heterosexual virgins.{" "}
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        I had a friend who was very sexually inexperienced and began dating a
        guy who had had sex with past girlfriends. This friend was devastated
        over the fact that her boyfriend had been with other women, and mourned
        the idea that they wouldn’t both be “pure” for each other at their
        wedding. However, in the end she decided that it was more understandable
        that the man would have stumbled sexually and was willing to still save
        herself for him. (They broke up, thank god).{" "}
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        Throughout my teens and early twenties, many of my friends who
        perscribed to the belief in not having sex before marriage, were
        constantly asking the question, “How far is too far?”. In other words,
        how much could they <i>do</i> and still be a virgin? I had so many
        friends that were having oral sex and giving their partner orgasms in
        various ways, but still carried the badge of “virgin” on their wedding
        night. It’s worth a sidenote here that since the evangelical church
        broadly agrees on homosexual conduct as being “sexual sin”, I am
        paradoxically both sinful and completely pure, as I have not had
        heterosexual (penetrative) sex. Jessica Valenti in{" "}
        <i>The Purity Myth</i>, explains that, “there is not and has never been
        a widely-accepted medical definition of virginity”. Therefore virginity
        is merely defined by those with the power to define it for you. This
        raises the question, can only straight people lose their virginity?{" "}

        When I first began exploring my sexuality with Chloe (my now wife), I
        was so out of touch with my body. I felt so much shame for experiencing
        pleasure and intimacy with another person, especially another woman. I
        began to develop really serious stomach pain that for months I couldn’t
        identify. Finally Chloe asked me if I thought that it could be anxiety
        around my sexuality. It was a discerning observation which turned out to
        be pretty darn accurate.{" "}

          How An Evangelical Dating Guide And Purity Culture Gave Me An Anxiety
          Disorder

        , explains a very similar experience:
        <Quote>
          “Dating and sex had felt dangerous and sinful for so long ― not to
          mention the biblical implications of dating a <i>woman</i>. I had
          trained myself to shut down all bodily desires and now that my desire
          had awakened, a fight or flight response had been activated. I
          couldn’t seem to convince my body that dating was safe. I realized
          that while I’d been convinced during my youth that I was making the
          choice to not date or have sex, I had actually been stripped of bodily
          agency. The fundamentalism of my upbringing had terrified me into
          submission.”

      <SubHeader>Other's experiences of Purity Culture.</SubHeader>
      <BlogParagraph>
        Many of my peers who were raised in this subculture have said that they
        still battle similar shame and trauma as a result of these teachings,
        making it difficult to develop healthy adult sexual relationships. Nadia
        Bolz Weber in her book <i>Shameless</i> shares stories of her
        parishioners as they have navigated their sexuality in the shadow of
        purity culture:
        <Quote>
          “Sex for Sara was at first incredibly painful, and for Tim incredibly
          frustrating. They both felt inadequate, angry, and confused,
          alternately blaming themselves and then each other. They had been told
          that if they followed the rules, they would have more satisfying and
          exciting sex than couples who'd had sex before marriage. The kind of
          sex that was better because it was pure. But when they got married,
          they found out that all of that was bullshit. The whole experience was
          crushingly disappointing… The church taught Tim and Sara that God was
          watching their every move, ready with a head shake. Like a controlling
          asshole with a killer surveillance system. And for a while that
          theology worked on Tim and Sara, as I know it has worked on so many.
          They buried their innate sexual development in order to please the
          master. And they entered marriage expecting their sex lives to be
          blessed accordingly.”
        </Quote>
        <Quote>
          “Trent had just spent an hour describing what he learned as a kid from
          his church: how the only way to please God, the same being who created
          him with a sexuality to begin with, was to not engage with his erotic
          nature whatsoever. As if the God of the Universe had programmed into
          creation a passive-aggressive test of our willpower.”
        </Quote>
      </BlogParagraph>
      <SubHeader>A way forward.</SubHeader>
      <BlogParagraph>
        Bolz Weber explains her invitation to what she calls a “sexual
        reformation” as “seeing ourselves more fully”, and invites us to “forge
        a new Christian sexual ethic-- one based not on a standardised list of
        <i>thou shall nots</i>, but on concern for each others flourishing.”
        Matthais Roberts, in his book <i>Beyond Shame</i>, says, “if it doesn’t feel healthy, if it doesn’t produce positive,
          enjoyable, life-giving results, it’s not sexual health.”
      </BlogParagraph>
      <BlogParagraph>
        To do that, we must dismantle the pillars that purity culture is built
        on: assumed heterosexuality, patriarchal ideas of mens sexual behaviours
        contrasted with asexual femininity, the idea that womens bodies are for
        the consumption of men and not for the pleasure of women (I mean, let’s
        talk about the clitoris. It’s the only biological component on any human
        body with the primary purpose of pleasure. Some scientists argue
        pleasure it's its ONLY function... just let that sink in). We need to put
        a stop to prohibition as an answer to excess, and instead form a nuanced
        and deep understanding of sex and intimacy. As humans we tend to
        compulsively segment life into a series of opposing binaries; especially
        in fundamentalist religious circles. Good or bad, pure or impure, virgin
        or whore, masculine or feminine... We cannot continue to take false
        black and white binaries and attempt to apply them to a full
        technicolour of humanity.
