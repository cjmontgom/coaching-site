          In August of 2018, as I was submitting my dissertation for my Masters
          in Gender Studies, I knew I didn’t want the ideas I was exploring to
          exist only within academic spaces. These ideas were BLOWING MY MIND
          and learning about it all was so fascinating. It wasn’t just an
          intellectual development, but it was seriously changing the way I
          viewed my life and the frameworks and narratives that I had inherited.
          So many of the scripts that we are handed as humans, especially those
          of us raised in religious communities, are presented to us as
          inherent, natural and divine Truths. Throughout the research process
          for my dissertation, I had the chance to hold each of the scripts up
          to the light and critically examine their origins and outcomes.

          So, after almost two years of the old gal living in my Google Drive, I
          have brushed off the digital dust and breathed some new life into my
          dissertation. I’ve reworked it into more manageable chunks and I’ll be
          publishing it in a six-part series. I have also gone back and written
          it in the way that I would have done if I weren’t being graded by
          “academics”. In other words, I tried to make it sound more like a
          human wrote it. Hopefully, while the richness of the concepts and
          research remain, there’ll be more of my own voice in this version than
          in the original (which you can definitely have a copy of to read if
          you’re having trouble sleeping these days).

          So, without further adieu, here is the introduction to the new &
          improved work,

          A 2017 article written in Christianity Today by Tish Harrison Warren,
          an Anglican priest from the US, claimed that there is a crisis of
          authority within the church in America. The location of this crisis?
          The internet. The reason for said crisis? Lady bloggers.

          , but I’ve recently discovered that Christianity Today has put a
          paywall up to read the article in its entirety. Lame. Sorry. I
          personally wouldn't recommend throwing your money at CT. All the
          important stuff you’ll need to know, I’m going to be quoting.

        <BlogParagraph>
          Let’s be honest, questions regarding women and how or if they fit into
          faith communities are not new. Religious historian and philosopher
          Barbara Newman states,
          <Quote>
            “From the earliest years of Christianity, the Church has had a
            problem with women.”
          </Quote>
          Historically, the Christian Church has cooperated with the patriarchal
          status quo and has perpetuated male-dominated structures of power and
          authority. However, despite these powerful forces working against
          women, they have been subverting such institutions throughout the
          ages, and creating spaces in which to speak, teach and lead. Christian
          women who have forged alternative spaces, is a classification in which
          I could be included. It was my own experience of navigating my
          femaleness within many different Christian spaces that made me so
          curious about studying all of this in more depth.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          The main argument running throughout Harrison Warren’s article is her
          insistence for increased institutional authority and oversight,
          specifically for Christian women online. She wonders where female
          bloggers feel they get their authority to take up space as influential
          voices and teachers of faith. She also raises questions surrounding
          what kind of theological training and/or ordination (or something
          similar), should be required for Christian leaders to possess the
          authority necessary to warrant their audience. I was fascinated by her
          article, so immediately after reading it, I did what every good
          millennial does; I headed to Twitter to get the tea. I wanted to see
          what people in my niche corner of ex-vangelical Twitter had to say
          about it, and ohhhhh, did they have some things to say. The
          conversations that followed, predominantly between Harrison Warren and
          the bloggers she wrote about (Rachel Held Evans, Sarah Bessey, Jen
          Hatmaker & Nish Weiseth), were chock full of interesting questions
          regarding power, authority and gender within Christianity in the
          United States. It was fascinating to see these women debate and
          challenge each other's perspectives in real time about issues that
          have such huge consequences for their lives, careers and faith.

        <BlogParagraph>
          So, what do you have to look forward to in the coming posts?
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          <b>Part I:</b> I’m going to do a high-level overview of gendered
          hierarchy and authority within Christianity and how that has been
          structured. My hope is to trace the origins and construction of power
          within the institutionalised church and explore how it has evolved
          throughout time.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          <b>Part II:</b> I’ll explore the notion that the church is inherently
          gendered. I’ll look at how ideas and beliefs become so normalised that
          we forget that they came from somewhere. Often, ideas, orthodoxy, or
          hierarchies are pitched to us as neutral and divine, but in actuality,
          they have a perspective and an agenda (often that agenda is power and
          how men can keep it).
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          <b>Part III:</b> Once we’ve gotten through our history lessons, which
          will hopefully be interesting and not a total snooze-fest, we’ll look
          at modern stories of women in church leadership. While many
          denominations have begun to ordain women over the last few decades
          (thank God!), there still remains deep-rooted systemic challenges.
          What happens when a group that has historically been left out,
          marginalised, and “othered” becomes a part of the acceptable in-group?
          What happens when women finally get a seat at the table? And for the
          women Harrison Warren describes in her article as ‘free agents’— those
          who teach, lead, serve outside of formal church leadership/authority—
          what are their unique challenges and opportunities?
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          <b>Part IV:</b> Heretics, Witches, Bloggers & Bitches was what I
          wanted to call this section in my dissertation but now I finally get
          the chance! We’re going back in time again (“those who do not remember
          the past are doomed to repeat it” and all that…) to meet another
          ‘unauthorised’ group; medieval women mystics. Between the bloggers and
          the mystics I’ll look at the conflict that arises between a seemingly
          binary choice; either submit oneself to patriarchal rule or operate
          outside of it and be labeled a heretic.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          <b>Part V:</b> We’re taking it 21st Century again and looking at how
          the internet and the democratization of information has contributed
          even further to questions surrounding authority. Both cultural and
          technological changes dramatically affect the ways in which we
          legitimise voices now. In this post, I’ll also explore how the
          internet has been a particularly important space for women and other
          marginalised voices who don’t have access to traditional forms of
          power and authority.
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          <b>Part VI:</b> Finally I’ll make my way round to talk about a way
          forward, offer some hope and talk a bit about my new favourite school
          of philosophy; phenomenology! Phenomenology looks at the “lived
          experience” as a legitimate form of knowledge. In other words; you, in
          all of your uniqueness, your life experiences, all that stuff you know
          to be true deep within yourself… is important and legitimate knowledge
          (capital T-Truth)! How do we legitimise women and marginalised groups
          real and lived spiritual experiences? Let’s discuss!
        </BlogParagraph>
        <BlogParagraph>
          I am really excited to explore these topics and so many more— I’m
          reworking other essays as well, including one all about ‘queering
          Christian family values’— so buckle up as we explore these ideas and
          tear down the patriarchy!
