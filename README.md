# Boilerplate App

An application with minimal packages and dependencies to use as a starter for small React/ Typescript projects. 


### Packages used

* Webpack-dev-server - a little Node.js Express server, which uses the webpack-dev-middleware to serve a webpack bundle for localhost.
* Babel - a JS transpiler that converts ES6 into ES5, which is more fully supported by browsers.
* Prettier - to make things pretty.
* Jest - paired with react-testing-library for testing rendered components.
